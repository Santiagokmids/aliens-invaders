* Description:

  Aliens invaders is a game that consists of eliminating all the aliens that come from space, where the player is a ship that is in charge of shooting these invaders.
  As the aliens are eliminated, they go down in order to shoot the ship or reach the point that is protecting the ship to defeat it, therefore, the player has to avoid being hit     by the projectiles that shoot the aliens and also prevent them from reaching their safe point.

  If the player is hit by a projectile, he will lose the game, but if he defeats all the aliens, new ones will appear with the same objective.
  The more aliens are destroyed, the more points the player will get.

  When the game is over, the player will enter their name to be in the "hall of fame" of best space protectors.
  As more aliens are destroyed, the difficulty of the game will increase, which means that the aliens will move faster than the previous level.
